As noted above, any use of the API constitutes use of the Services and any use of the API is governed by these Factual Terms of Service.

Factual, in its sole discretion, may at any time change the specifications of or restrict or limit access to the APIs. Factual may suspend or throttle Services until we believe the number of API calls will not exceed capacity limitations. You will not take steps to circumvent any technical measures Factual may put in place to implement throttling or suspension. You may not use the Site or the Factual API for customer or lead generation, general marketing and sales research, inclusion in paid services or real-time ad targeting (Contact Factual if you are interested in any of these use cases).
