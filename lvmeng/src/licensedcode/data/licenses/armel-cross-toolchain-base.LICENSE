COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTIONCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities withrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license isintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor whoincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a mannerwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, ifa Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, suchContributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnifyevery other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damagesand costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legalactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to theextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor inconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial productoffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Lossesrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In orderto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the CommercialContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributorto control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense andany related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor mayparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial productoffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If thatCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warrantiesrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are suchCommercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, theCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the otherContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a courtrequires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the CommercialContributor must pay those damages.5.
