If you are accepting the terms of this EULA on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this EULA, and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

GoPro reserves all rights in the Software not expressly granted to you in this EULA.2. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.

You may not use, copy, display or distribute the GoPro Edit Templates or the included content in any other manner or for any other purpose, and GoPro and its licensors retain all copyrights and other proprietary rights in the GoPro Edit Templates and such content.  If you use the GoPro bumpers you must retain them without modification.  In addition, you may not use the GoPro Edit Templates to create, distribute or display any User Videos or other content that: (i) is defamatory, obscene or pornographic; (ii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (iii) infringes, misappropriates or violates a third party’s intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation; (vi) promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any person or entity; or (vi) promotes illegal activities or substances.

GOPRO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED FROM GOPRO OR ELSEWHERE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS EULA.  10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete understanding and agreement concerning the subject matter between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties, unless you and GoPro have executed a separate agreement. GoPro reserves the right to modify this EULA and will give you reasonable notice of any changes.  Your continued use of the Software after such notice will indicate your consent to any such changes. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this EULA will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. You may not assign or transfer this EULA or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without GoPro’s prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. GoPro expressly reserves the right to freely assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under California law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any legal action or proceeding arising under this EULA shall be the state and federal courts in San Mateo County, California, and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.16.
