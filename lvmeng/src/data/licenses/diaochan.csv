735,AGPL-3.0-only,GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 only,"GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 19 November 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensurecooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works aredesigned to take away your freedom to share and change theworks. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intendedto guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of aprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protectyour rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on thesoftware, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvementsmade in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespreaduse, become available for other developers to incorporate. Manydevelopers of free software are heartened and encouraged by theresulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on networkservers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General PublicLicense permits making a modified version and letting the public accessit on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specificallyto ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomesavailable to the community. It requires the operator of anetwork server to provide the source code of the modified versionrunning there to the users of that server. Therefore, public useof a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, givesthe public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and publishedby Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a differentlicense, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a newversion of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 ofthe GNU Affero General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that applyto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed underthis License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees""and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of thework in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than themaking of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modifiedversion"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodifiedProgram or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing iton a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includescopying, distribution (with or without modification), making availableto the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagationthat enables other parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through a computernetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except tothe extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may conveythe work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferredform of the work for making modifications to it.""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the caseof interfaces specified for a particular programming language,one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal formof packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form. A""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form meansall the source code needed to generate, install, and (for anexecutable work) run the object code and to modify the work,including scripts to control those activities. However, it doesnot include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose toolsor generally available free programs which are used unmodified inperforming those activities but which are not part of the work.For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definitionfiles associated with source files for the work, and the sourcecode for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprogramsthat the work is specifically designed to require, such as byintimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users canregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a workin source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of havingthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you withfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copiesof your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permittedsolely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensingis not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power toforbid circumvention of technological measures to the extentsuch circumvention is effected by exercising rights under thisLicense with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim anyintention to limit operation or modification of the work as a meansof enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code asyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyrightnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to thecode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; andgive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that youconvey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the termsof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices statingthat you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating thatit is released under this License and any conditionsadded under section 7. This requirement modifies therequirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this Licenseto anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This Licensewill therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives nopermission to license the work in any other way, but it does notinvalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each mustdisplay Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Programhas interactive interfaces that do not display AppropriateLegal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the coveredwork, and which are not combined with it such as to form a largerprogram, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resultingcopyright are not used to limit the access or legal rightsof the compilation's users beyond what the individual workspermit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does notcause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code formunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that youalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Sourceunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physicalproduct (including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by awritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid foras long as you offer spare parts or customer support for thatproduct model, to give anyone who possesses the object codeeither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the softwarein the product that is covered by this License, on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange,for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physicallyperforming this conveying of source, or (2) access to copythe Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with acopy of the written offer to provide the CorrespondingSource. This alternative is allowed only occasionallyand noncommercially, and only if you received the objectcode with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to theCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place atno further charge. You need not require recipients to copy theCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the placeto copy the object code is a network server, the CorrespondingSource may be on a different server (operated by you or a thirdparty) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided youmaintain clear directions next to the object code saying whereto find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hoststhe Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that itis available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,provided you inform other peers where the object codeand Corresponding Source of the work are being offeredto the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code isexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which meansany tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or soldfor incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a productis a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favorof coverage. For a particular product received by a particularuser, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of thatclass of product, regardless of the status of the particularuser or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is aconsumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such usesrepresent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information requiredto install and execute modified versions of a covered work inthat User Product from a modified version of its CorrespondingSource. The information must suffice to ensure that the continuedfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case preventedor interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveyingoccurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possessionand use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient inperpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transactionis characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under thissection must be accompanied by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any thirdparty retains the ability to install modified object code on theUser Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does notinclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,warranty, or updates for a work that has been modifiedor installed by the recipient, or for the User Product inwhich it has been modified or installed. Access to a networkmay be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violatesthe rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Informationprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format thatis publicly documented (and with an implementation availableto the public in source code form), and must require nospecial password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Programshall be treated as though they were included in this License, tothe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additionalpermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be usedseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remainsgoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any partof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holdersof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differentlyfrom the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legalnotices or author attributions in that material or in theAppropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,or requiring that modified versions of such material be markedin reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of namesof licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for useof some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of thatmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modifiedversions of it) with contractual assumptions of liabilityto the recipient, for any liability that these contractualassumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""furtherrestrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Programas you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice statingthat it is governed by this License along with a term that isa further restriction, you may remove that term. If a licensedocument contains a further restriction but permits relicensing orconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work materialgoverned by the terms of that license document, provided that thefurther restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with thissection, you must place, in the relevant source files, astatement of the additional terms that apply to those files,or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may bestated in the form of a separately written license, or statedas exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except asexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwiseto propagate or modify it is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License (including any patentlicenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does notterminate the licenses of parties who have received copies orrights from you under this License. If your rights have beenterminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualifyto receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagateor modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if youdo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control ofan organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividingan organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of acovered work results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, youmay not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exerciseof rights granted under this License, and you may not initiatelitigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patentclaims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether alreadyacquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by somemanner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or sellingits contributor version, but do not include claims that wouldbe infringed only as a consequence of further modificationof the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is anyexpress agreement or commitment, however denominated, not toenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practicea patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such anagreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patentlicense, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not availablefor anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of thisLicense, through a publicly available network server or otherreadily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause theCorresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange todeprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for thisparticular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent withthe requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying"" means you haveactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveyingthe covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of thecovered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiablepatents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyanceof, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of theparties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,then the patent license you grant is automatically extendedto all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within thescope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditionedon the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specificallygranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work ifyou are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in thebusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment tothe third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding orlimiting any implied license or other defenses to infringementthat may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of thisLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of thisLicense. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfysimultaneously your obligations under this License and any otherpertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to termsthat obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveyingfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the onlyway you could satisfy both those terms and this Licensewould be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modifythe Program, your modified version must prominently offer all usersinteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if yourversion supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive theCorresponding Source of your version by providing access to theCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge, throughsome standard or customary means of facilitating copying ofsoftware. This Corresponding Source shall include the CorrespondingSource for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General PublicLicense that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a worklicensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License intoa single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. Theterms of this License will continue to apply to the part whichis the covered work, but the work with which it is combined willremain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNUAffero General Public License ""or any later version"" applies toit, you have the option of following the terms and conditionseither of that numbered version or of any later version publishedby the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specifya version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you maychoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can beused, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a versionpermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional ordifferent permissions. However, no additional obligationsare imposed on any author or copyright holder as aresult of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTEDBY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITINGTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIESOF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THEENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/ORCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGESARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDINGBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATEOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THEPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liabilityprovided above cannot be given local legal effect according totheir terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that mostclosely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability inconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption ofliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name anda brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation, eitherversion 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warrantyof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General	Public License along with this program. If not, see	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through acomputer network, you should also make sure that it provides away for users to get its source. For example, if your program isa web application, its interface could display a ""Source"" linkthat leads users to an archive of the code. There are many waysyou could offer source, and different solutions will be better fordifferent programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" forthe program, if necessary.

Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensurecooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works aredesigned to take away your freedom to share and change theworks. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intendedto guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of aprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protectyour rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on thesoftware, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvementsmade in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespreaduse, become available for other developers to incorporate. Manydevelopers of free software are heartened and encouraged by theresulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on networkservers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General PublicLicense permits making a modified version and letting the public accessit on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specificallyto ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomesavailable to the community. It requires the operator of anetwork server to provide the source code of the modified versionrunning there to the users of that server. Therefore, public useof a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, givesthe public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and publishedby Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a differentlicense, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a newversion of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 ofthe GNU Affero General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that applyto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed underthis License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees""and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of thework in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than themaking of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modifiedversion"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodifiedProgram or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing iton a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includescopying, distribution (with or without modification), making availableto the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagationthat enables other parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through a computernetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except tothe extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may conveythe work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferredform of the work for making modifications to it.""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the caseof interfaces specified for a particular programming language,one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal formof packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form. A""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form meansall the source code needed to generate, install, and (for anexecutable work) run the object code and to modify the work,including scripts to control those activities. However, it doesnot include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose toolsor generally available free programs which are used unmodified inperforming those activities but which are not part of the work.For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definitionfiles associated with source files for the work, and the sourcecode for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprogramsthat the work is specifically designed to require, such as byintimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users canregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a workin source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of havingthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you withfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copiesof your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permittedsolely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensingis not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power toforbid circumvention of technological measures to the extentsuch circumvention is effected by exercising rights under thisLicense with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim anyintention to limit operation or modification of the work as a meansof enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code asyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyrightnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to thecode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; andgive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that youconvey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the termsof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices statingthat you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating thatit is released under this License and any conditionsadded under section 7. This requirement modifies therequirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this Licenseto anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This Licensewill therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives nopermission to license the work in any other way, but it does notinvalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each mustdisplay Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Programhas interactive interfaces that do not display AppropriateLegal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the coveredwork, and which are not combined with it such as to form a largerprogram, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resultingcopyright are not used to limit the access or legal rightsof the compilation's users beyond what the individual workspermit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does notcause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code formunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that youalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Sourceunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physicalproduct (including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by awritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid foras long as you offer spare parts or customer support for thatproduct model, to give anyone who possesses the object codeeither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the softwarein the product that is covered by this License, on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange,for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physicallyperforming this conveying of source, or (2) access to copythe Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with acopy of the written offer to provide the CorrespondingSource. This alternative is allowed only occasionallyand noncommercially, and only if you received the objectcode with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to theCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place atno further charge. You need not require recipients to copy theCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the placeto copy the object code is a network server, the CorrespondingSource may be on a different server (operated by you or a thirdparty) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided youmaintain clear directions next to the object code saying whereto find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hoststhe Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that itis available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,provided you inform other peers where the object codeand Corresponding Source of the work are being offeredto the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code isexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which meansany tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or soldfor incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a productis a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favorof coverage. For a particular product received by a particularuser, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of thatclass of product, regardless of the status of the particularuser or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is aconsumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such usesrepresent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information requiredto install and execute modified versions of a covered work inthat User Product from a modified version of its CorrespondingSource. The information must suffice to ensure that the continuedfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case preventedor interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveyingoccurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possessionand use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient inperpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transactionis characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under thissection must be accompanied by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any thirdparty retains the ability to install modified object code on theUser Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does notinclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,warranty, or updates for a work that has been modifiedor installed by the recipient, or for the User Product inwhich it has been modified or installed. Access to a networkmay be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violatesthe rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Informationprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format thatis publicly documented (and with an implementation availableto the public in source code form), and must require nospecial password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Programshall be treated as though they were included in this License, tothe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additionalpermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be usedseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remainsgoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any partof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holdersof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differentlyfrom the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legalnotices or author attributions in that material or in theAppropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,or requiring that modified versions of such material be markedin reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of namesof licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for useof some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of thatmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modifiedversions of it) with contractual assumptions of liabilityto the recipient, for any liability that these contractualassumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""furtherrestrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Programas you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice statingthat it is governed by this License along with a term that isa further restriction, you may remove that term. If a licensedocument contains a further restriction but permits relicensing orconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work materialgoverned by the terms of that license document, provided that thefurther restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with thissection, you must place, in the relevant source files, astatement of the additional terms that apply to those files,or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may bestated in the form of a separately written license, or statedas exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except asexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwiseto propagate or modify it is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License (including any patentlicenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does notterminate the licenses of parties who have received copies orrights from you under this License. If your rights have beenterminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualifyto receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagateor modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if youdo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control ofan organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividingan organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of acovered work results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, youmay not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exerciseof rights granted under this License, and you may not initiatelitigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patentclaims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether alreadyacquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by somemanner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or sellingits contributor version, but do not include claims that wouldbe infringed only as a consequence of further modificationof the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is anyexpress agreement or commitment, however denominated, not toenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practicea patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such anagreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patentlicense, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not availablefor anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of thisLicense, through a publicly available network server or otherreadily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause theCorresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange todeprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for thisparticular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent withthe requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying"" means you haveactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveyingthe covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of thecovered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiablepatents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyanceof, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of theparties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,then the patent license you grant is automatically extendedto all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within thescope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditionedon the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specificallygranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work ifyou are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in thebusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment tothe third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding orlimiting any implied license or other defenses to infringementthat may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of thisLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of thisLicense. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfysimultaneously your obligations under this License and any otherpertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to termsthat obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveyingfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the onlyway you could satisfy both those terms and this Licensewould be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modifythe Program, your modified version must prominently offer all usersinteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if yourversion supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive theCorresponding Source of your version by providing access to theCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge, throughsome standard or customary means of facilitating copying ofsoftware. This Corresponding Source shall include the CorrespondingSource for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General PublicLicense that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a worklicensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License intoa single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. Theterms of this License will continue to apply to the part whichis the covered work, but the work with which it is combined willremain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNUAffero General Public License ""or any later version"" applies toit, you have the option of following the terms and conditionseither of that numbered version or of any later version publishedby the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specifya version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you maychoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can beused, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a versionpermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional ordifferent permissions. However, no additional obligationsare imposed on any author or copyright holder as aresult of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTEDBY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITINGTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIESOF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THEENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/ORCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGESARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDINGBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATEOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THEPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liabilityprovided above cannot be given local legal effect according totheir terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that mostclosely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability inconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption ofliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name anda brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation, eitherversion 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warrantyof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General	Public License along with this program. If not, see	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through acomputer network, you should also make sure that it provides away for users to get its source. For example, if your program isa web application, its interface could display a ""Source"" linkthat leads users to an archive of the code. There are many waysyou could offer source, and different solutions will be better fordifferent programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" forthe program, if necessary.

PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS. (a) This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any patent license (the ""PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE""). (b) However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License which includes a patent license (the ""PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE"") by selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such future copies under this License. (c) If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license. (d) Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. 2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER. Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Work. 2.4. RESERVATION. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein. 3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. 3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY. (a) A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work. (b) All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in a file called ""license.txt."" In addition, the License Notice in Part 5 of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the Licensed Work. 3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK. A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an ""EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION"") to any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or (b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months. For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination. 3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS. When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution. 3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE. Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. 3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS. Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient's own corporation or organization (collectively, ""INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS""). The Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive. 3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES. This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements. 3.7. LARGER WORKS. Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work. 3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS. (a) Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works. (b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the ""EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS"") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the ""NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS"") for documenting such changes. (c) Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an ""Earlier LICENSED COPY"") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements. (d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work. (e) An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License. 3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME. The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior written permission. 3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR. (a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur (the ""ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION""). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the ""ATTRIBUTION LIMITS""). (b) If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial Contributor. (c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License. 3.11. For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect. 4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY. 4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES. A Recipient (""COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT"") may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, ""SERVICES"") to one or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)). 4.2. INDEMNITY. Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor (""COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an ""INDEMNIFIED PARTY"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""LOSSES"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. 5.1. NEW VERSIONS. The Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS. Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS DISCLAIMER. 6.2. RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 7. TERMINATION. 7.1. This License shall continue until terminated in accordance with the express terms herein. 7.2. Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time. 7.3. This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach. Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this License. 7.4. Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient under a copy of this License (in each case, an ""Other License"" and in plural, ""Other Licenses"") shall survive any such termination of this License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 7.5. Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination. 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND/OR AGENTS (AS THE CASE MAY BE), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, INDIRECT DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, OR ANY OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK OR ANY PART THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THAT RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) IN RELATION TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 9. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL ACTION. 9.1. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York. 9.2. The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality, validity, existence and enforceability of this License. Each party to this License hereby irrevocably attorns to and accepts the jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing Jurisdiction for such purposes. 9.3. Except as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, in the event of any action or proceeding brought by any party against another under this License the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable. 10. MISCELLANEOUS. 10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the benefit of the Initial Contributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Contributor and/or any other Recipient may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against any Recipient. 10.2.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 10.4. The language in all parts of this License shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 10.5. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 10.6. The paragraph headings of this License are for reference and convenience only and are not a part of this License, and they shall have no effect upon the construction or interpretation of any part hereof. 10.7. Each of the terms ""including"", ""include"" and ""includes"", when used in this License, is not limiting whether or not non-limiting language (such as ""without limitation"" or ""but not limited to"" or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto. 10.8. The parties hereto acknowledge they have expressly required that this License and notices relating thereto be drafted in the English language. //***THE LICENSE TERMS END HERE (OTHER THAN AS SET OUT IN EXHIBIT A).***// EXHIBIT A (to the Adaptive Public License) 	 PART 1: INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR AND DESIGNATED WEB SITE The Initial Contributor is: ________________________________________________ [Enter full name of Initial Contributor] Address of Initial Contributor: ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ [Enter address above] The Designated Web Site is: ________________________________________________ [Enter URL for Designated Web Site of Initial Contributor] NOTE: The Initial Contributor is to complete this Part 1, along with Parts 2, 3, and 5, and, if applicable, Parts 4 and 6.

B. The Initial Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by the Initial Contributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of such Initial Work or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph B by the Initial Contributor: (1) for any code that the Initial Contributor deletes from the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Initial Contributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Initial Work (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Initial Contributor. C.

The termination shall be effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from User to Recipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent litigation claim before the end of the ninety (90) day period. To be effective, any such notice of license termination must include a specific list of applicable patents and/or a copy of the copyrighted work of User that User alleges will be infringed by Recipient upon License termination. License termination is only effective with respect to patents and/or copyrights for which proper notice has been given.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License. Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed. Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license. (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version. Aggregating or Linking the Package (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation. (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package. Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license. General Provisions (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license. (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license. (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder. (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

487,BitTorrent-1.1,BitTorrent Open Source License v1.1,"BitTorrent Open Source License Version 1.1 This BitTorrent Open Source License (the ""License"") applies to the BitTorrent client and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance releases of that software (""BitTorrent Products"") that are distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. (""Licensor""). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product. Preamble This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the ""JOSL""), which has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted. This License provides that: 1. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required. 2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms ""Licensed Product,"" ""Modifications,"" ""Contributors"" and ""Source Code"" are defined in the License.) 3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term ""Derivative Works"" is defined in the License.) 4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others free of charge and without a royalty. 5. You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such executable versions contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications, you may not sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages. 6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code. 7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate. You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product. Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications. New versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions of this License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor after the release of the new version of this License. Only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License. License Terms 1. Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by a Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works. b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. ""Modifications"" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term ""Licensed Product"" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a ""Contributor"") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works. b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to you in any manner or in any media. 4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution. a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(d). b. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without charge, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an ""Electronic Distribution Mechanism""). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for as long as any executable or other form of the Licensed Product is distributed by you. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. c. Intellectual Property Matters. i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained. ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (""API"") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. d. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the ""Notice"") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer. e. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer. f. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto. g. Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed Products, Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, by distributing, selling, licensing, sublicensing or otherwise making available any Licensed Product, or Modification or Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree that you may sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any other Contributor, provided that such executable versions (i) contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise material Derivative Works. For purposes of this License, an executable version of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third party's software programs or other code, and/or the Licensed Product is combined with a number of your own or a third party's software programs or code, respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute material value, functionality or features to the License Product. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work, in each case as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable. Additionally, without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, you cannot charge for, sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code. 5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it. 6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference. 7. Versions of This License. a. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. b. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version, provided that any such license be in full force and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or otherwise terminated. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version (but not any prior version) of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License. c. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor. 8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 9. Termination. a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of being notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of this provision, proof of delivery via email to the address listed in the 'WHOIS' database of the registrar for any website through which you distribute or market any Licensed Product, or to any alternate email address which you designate in writing to the Licensor, shall constitute sufficient notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they continue to complye with the terms of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the ""Notice Period"") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 10. Limitation of Liability.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 11. Responsibility for Claims.

Purpose This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to which it applies (the ""Work""), either as-is or in modified form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software from liability. This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties who receive the Work from you.If any non-affiliated third party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your actions. The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below. ## 2. Receiving a License In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow. ### 2.1. Application The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a ""Modified Work""). Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work. ### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by Licensor. ### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via specific performance. ## 3. Permissions ### 3.1. Permissions Granted Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to: + a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject; and + b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1: + a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other software or hardware. + b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License. ## 4.

Provide Access to Source Code Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code corresponding to the Work (""Access""). The ""Source Code"" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications, including any comments, configuration information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work. #### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one year thereafter. #### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work.

Scope of Conditions in this License You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone. ### 4.5. Combined Work Exception As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the ""Combined Work Exception,"" or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a ""Larger Work."" So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient's ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice. ## 5. Term and Termination The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (""Term"").

You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lastingmore than sixty days or b) subsequent termination fornoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing. ### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation. ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. ## 7. Other Provisions ### 7.1. Affiliates An ""Affiliate"" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates. ### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees. ### 7.3. No Sublicensing This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients' exercise of the permissions granted herein. ### 7.4. Attorneys' Fees In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A ""prevailing party"" is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License. ### 7.5. No Waiver Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor's ability to enforce such provision at a later time. ### 7.6. Severability If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect. ### 7.7. License for the Text of this License The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that any modifications of this license may not use the name ""Cryptographic Autonomy License"" or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe any derived work of this License.",,False,N,N,False

546,CATOSL-1.1,Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License 1.1,"Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License Version 1.1 PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (""LICENSE""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE. License Background Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License. This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License. The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program. 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program. 1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program. 1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter. 1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. 1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. 1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions. 1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor. 2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor. 2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License. 3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and * its license agreement: * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner. 3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form: * it must be made available under this License; and * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself. 3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained. 3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS 4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program. 5. NO WARRANTY 5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING 7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program. 7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program. 8. PATENT LITIGATION 8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 9. OWNERSHIP 9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 10. TERMINATION 10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination. 11. GENERAL 11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License. 11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License.

This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. e.

If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c.

Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. a.

388,CC0-1.0,Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal,"Creative Commons Legal Code CC0 1.0 Universal CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN ""AS-IS"" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ""owner"") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a ""Work""). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (""Commons"") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the ""Affirmer""), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (""Copyright and Related Rights""). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the ""Waiver""). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the ""License""). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 4. Limitations and Disclaimers. a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.",,False,N,N,False

Therefore, the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark. Article 10 - TERMINATION 10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective. 10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof. Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc. 11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to invoke said provision(s) subsequently. 11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives. 11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid. 11.5 LANGUAGE The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions are deemed authentic. Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT 12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement. 12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number.

Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be made by You pursuant to subsection 3.2. 6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY 6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence. 6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to such use. 7 Patents 7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4) patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor. 7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated. 8 General 8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain effective. 8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel. 8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN. You may treat Covered Source licensed under CERN-OHL-W as licensed under CERN-OHL-S if and only if all Available Components referenced in the Covered Source comply with the corresponding definition of Available Component for CERN-OHL-S. 8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. 8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your Licence from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this Licence by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance in all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any termination. 8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.",,False,N,N,False

Distribution Obligations. 3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4 Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1 New Versions. Socialtext, Inc. (""Socialtext"") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""Socialtext"", ""CPAL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A. 14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION (a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code (""Original Developer""), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (""Attribution Information"") a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an ""about"" display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice. (b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a URL (""Attribution Information"") and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the ""Attribution Limits""). (c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer. (d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License. 15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

612,CPL-1.0,Common Public License 1.0,"Common Public License Version 1.0 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS ""Contribution"" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. ""Contributor"" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. ""Licensed Patents "" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. ""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. ""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",,False,N,N,False

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims.

If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. CUA Office Project may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CUA Office Project. No one other than CUA Office Project has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""CUA Office"", ""CUA"", ""CUAPL"", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CUA Office Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as ""Multiple-Licensed"". ""Multiple-Licensed"" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific way. 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications, by mail order. 5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose for that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use this Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded. 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called ""undump"" or ""unexec"" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package. 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 9.

671,EPL-1.0,Eclipse Public License 1.0,"Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS ""Contribution"" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. ""Contributor"" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. ""Licensed Patents"" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. ""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. ""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",,False,N,N,False

This patentlicense shallapply to the combination of the Contribution and theProgram if,at the time the Contribution is added by theContributor, suchaddition of the Contribution causes suchcombination to be coveredby the Licensed Patents. The patentlicense shall not apply to anyother combinations which include theContribution.

As a condition to exercising therightsand licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient herebyassumes soleresponsibility to secure any other intellectualproperty rightsneeded,if any. For example, if a third party patentlicense is required toallow Recipient to Distribute the Program,it is Recipient'sresponsibility to acquire that licensebefore distributing theProgram. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it hassufficientcopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grantthe copyrightlicense set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributormakes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those setforthin this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient'sreceipt oftheProgram under the terms of a Secondary License (ifpermitted underthe terms of Section 3). 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, inaccordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompanythe Program with a statement that the Source Code for theProgramis available under this Agreement, and informs Recipientshow toobtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a mediumcustomarilyused for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a licensedifferent than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors allwarranties and conditions, express and implied, includingwarrantiesor conditions of title and non-infringement, andimpliedwarrantiesor conditions of merchantability and fitnessfor a particularpurpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors allliability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,incidentaland consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rightsin theSource Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by anypartyto be under a license that satisfies the requirements ofthissection 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if theProgram (i)is combined with other material in a separate file orfiles madeavailableunder a Secondary License, and (ii) theinitial Contributor attachedtothe Source Code the noticedescribed in Exhibit A of thisAgreement,then the Program may bemade available under the terms of suchSecondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of theProgram. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,trademark,attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, orlimitations of liability(""notices"")contained within the Programfrom any copy of the Program whichthey Distribute, provided thatContributors may add their ownappropriatenotices. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice ""This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.""

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text: """""" Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. """""" Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms 0. Definitions Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3. Advertising Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. 4.

834,GFDL-1.1-only,GNU Free Documentation License v1.1 only,"GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.1, March 2000 Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,or other written document ""free"" in the sense of freedom: toassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistributeit, with or without modifying it, either commercially ornoncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for theauthor and publisher a way to get credit for their work, whilenot being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of ""copyleft"", which means thatderivative works of the document must themselves be free inthe same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals forfree software, because free software needs free documentation: a freeprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that thesoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter orwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Licenseprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work thatcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder sayingit can be distributed under the terms of this License. The""Document"", below, refers to any such manual or work. Anymember of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as ""you"". A ""Modified Version"" of the Document means any work containingthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, orwith modifications and/or translated into another language. A ""Secondary Section"" is a named appendix or a front-matter sectionof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationshipof the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document'soverall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothingthat could fall directly within that overall subject. (Forexample, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) Therelationship could be a matter of historical connection withthe subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The ""Invariant Sections"" are certain Secondary Sections whosetitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in thenotice that says that the Document is released under this License. The ""Cover Texts"" are certain short passages of text that arelisted, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the noticethat says that the Document is released under this License. A ""Transparent"" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,represented in a format whose specification is available to thegeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directlyand straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for imagescomposed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) somewidely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for inputto text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety offormats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in anotherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designedto thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is notTransparent. A copy that is not ""Transparent"" is called ""Opaque"". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies includeplain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeXinput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, andstandard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formatsthat can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools arenot generally available, and the machine-generated HTMLproduced by some word processors for output purposes only. The ""Title Page"" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, thematerial this License requires to appear in the title page. Forworks in formats which do not have any title page as such, ""TitlePage"" means the text near the most prominent appearance of thework's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, eithercommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, thecopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License appliesto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add noother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may notuse technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or furthercopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may acceptcompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enoughnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditionsstated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, youmust enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, andBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearlyand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. Thefront cover must present the full title with all words of the titleequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on thecovers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, aslong as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy theseconditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are toovoluminous to fit legibly, you should put the firstones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actualcover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Documentnumbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readableTransparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or witheach Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network locationcontaining a complete Transparent copy of the Document, freeof added material, which the general network-using public hasaccess to download anonymously at no charge using public-standardnetwork protocols. If you use the latter option, you must takereasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaquecopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy willremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least oneyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directlyor through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contactthe authors of the Document well before redistributingany large number of copies, to give them a chance toprovide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document underthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you releasethe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the ModifiedVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distributionand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copyof it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinctfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History sectionof the Document). You may use the same title as a previous versionif the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entitiesresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the ModifiedVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of theDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). C. State on the Title page the name of the publisherof the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for yourmodifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license noticegiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under theterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sectionsand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled ""History"", and its title, and addto it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the TitlePage. If there is no section entitled ""History"" in the Document,create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisherof the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an itemdescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Documentfor public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, andlikewise the network locations given in the Document for previousversions it was based on. These may be placed in the ""History""section. You may omit a network location for a work that waspublished at least four years before the Document itself, or if theoriginal publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. In any section entitled ""Acknowledgements"" or ""Dedications"",preserve the section's title, and preserve in the sectionall the substance and tone of each of the contributoracknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unalteredin their text and in their titles. Section numbers or theequivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section entitled ""Endorsements"". Such asection may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section as ""Endorsements""or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections orappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no materialcopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some orall of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titlesto the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's licensenotice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section entitled ""Endorsements"", providedit contains nothing but endorsements of your ModifiedVersion by various parties--for example, statements ofpeer review or that the text has been approved by anorganization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end ofthe list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passageof Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (orthrough arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document alreadyincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you orby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicitpermission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by thisLicense give permission to use their names for publicity foror to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents releasedunder this License, under the terms defined in section 4above for modified versions, provided that you include inthe combination all of the Invariant Sections of all ofthe original documents, unmodified, and list them all asInvariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, andmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a singlecopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same namebut different contents, make the title of each such section uniqueby adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the originalauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a uniquenumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the listof Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled""History"" in the various original documents, forming one sectionentitled ""History""; likewise combine any sections entitled""Acknowledgements"", and any sections entitled ""Dedications"".You must delete all sections entitled ""Endorsements."" 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document andother documents released under this License, and replace theindividual copies of this License in the various documentswith a single copy that is included in the collection,provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatimcopying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection,and distribute it individually under this License,provided you insert a copy of this License into theextracted document, and follow this License in all otherrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separateand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storageor distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a ModifiedVersion of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimedfor the compilation. Such a compilation is called an ""aggregate"",and this License does not apply to the other self-contained worksthus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thuscompiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to thesecopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarterof the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placedon covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you maydistribute translations of the Document under the terms ofsection 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requiresspecial permission from their copyright holders, but you mayinclude translations of some or all Invariant Sections in additionto the original versions of these Invariant Sections.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,or other written document ""free"" in the sense of freedom: toassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistributeit, with or without modifying it, either commercially ornoncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for theauthor and publisher a way to get credit for their work, whilenot being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of ""copyleft"", which means thatderivative works of the document must themselves be free inthe same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals forfree software, because free software needs free documentation: a freeprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that thesoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter orwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Licenseprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work thatcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder sayingit can be distributed under the terms of this License. The""Document"", below, refers to any such manual or work. Anymember of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as ""you"". A ""Modified Version"" of the Document means any work containingthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, orwith modifications and/or translated into another language. A ""Secondary Section"" is a named appendix or a front-matter sectionof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationshipof the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document'soverall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothingthat could fall directly within that overall subject. (Forexample, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) Therelationship could be a matter of historical connection withthe subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The ""Invariant Sections"" are certain Secondary Sections whosetitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in thenotice that says that the Document is released under this License. The ""Cover Texts"" are certain short passages of text that arelisted, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the noticethat says that the Document is released under this License. A ""Transparent"" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,represented in a format whose specification is available to thegeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directlyand straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for imagescomposed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) somewidely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for inputto text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety offormats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in anotherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designedto thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is notTransparent. A copy that is not ""Transparent"" is called ""Opaque"". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies includeplain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeXinput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, andstandard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formatsthat can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools arenot generally available, and the machine-generated HTMLproduced by some word processors for output purposes only. The ""Title Page"" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, thematerial this License requires to appear in the title page. Forworks in formats which do not have any title page as such, ""TitlePage"" means the text near the most prominent appearance of thework's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, eithercommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, thecopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License appliesto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add noother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may notuse technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or furthercopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may acceptcompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enoughnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditionsstated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, youmust enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, andBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearlyand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. Thefront cover must present the full title with all words of the titleequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on thecovers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, aslong as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy theseconditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are toovoluminous to fit legibly, you should put the firstones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actualcover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Documentnumbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readableTransparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or witheach Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network locationcontaining a complete Transparent copy of the Document, freeof added material, which the general network-using public hasaccess to download anonymously at no charge using public-standardnetwork protocols. If you use the latter option, you must takereasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaquecopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy willremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least oneyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directlyor through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contactthe authors of the Document well before redistributingany large number of copies, to give them a chance toprovide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document underthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you releasethe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the ModifiedVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distributionand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copyof it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinctfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History sectionof the Document). You may use the same title as a previous versionif the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entitiesresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the ModifiedVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of theDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). C. State on the Title page the name of the publisherof the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for yourmodifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license noticegiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under theterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sectionsand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled ""History"", and its title, and addto it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the TitlePage. If there is no section entitled ""History"" in the Document,create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisherof the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an itemdescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Documentfor public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, andlikewise the network locations given in the Document for previousversions it was based on. These may be placed in the ""History""section. You may omit a network location for a work that waspublished at least four years before the Document itself, or if theoriginal publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. In any section entitled ""Acknowledgements"" or ""Dedications"",preserve the section's title, and preserve in the sectionall the substance and tone of each of the contributoracknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unalteredin their text and in their titles. Section numbers or theequivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section entitled ""Endorsements"". Such asection may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section as ""Endorsements""or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections orappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no materialcopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some orall of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titlesto the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's licensenotice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section entitled ""Endorsements"", providedit contains nothing but endorsements of your ModifiedVersion by various parties--for example, statements ofpeer review or that the text has been approved by anorganization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end ofthe list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passageof Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (orthrough arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document alreadyincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you orby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicitpermission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by thisLicense give permission to use their names for publicity foror to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents releasedunder this License, under the terms defined in section 4above for modified versions, provided that you include inthe combination all of the Invariant Sections of all ofthe original documents, unmodified, and list them all asInvariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, andmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a singlecopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same namebut different contents, make the title of each such section uniqueby adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the originalauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a uniquenumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the listof Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled""History"" in the various original documents, forming one sectionentitled ""History""; likewise combine any sections entitled""Acknowledgements"", and any sections entitled ""Dedications"".You must delete all sections entitled ""Endorsements."" 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document andother documents released under this License, and replace theindividual copies of this License in the various documentswith a single copy that is included in the collection,provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatimcopying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection,and distribute it individually under this License,provided you insert a copy of this License into theextracted document, and follow this License in all otherrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separateand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storageor distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a ModifiedVersion of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimedfor the compilation. Such a compilation is called an ""aggregate"",and this License does not apply to the other self-contained worksthus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thuscompiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to thesecopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarterof the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placedon covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you maydistribute translations of the Document under the terms ofsection 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requiresspecial permission from their copyright holders, but you mayinclude translations of some or all Invariant Sections in additionto the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You mayinclude a translation of this License provided that you alsoinclude the original English version of this License. In case ofa disagreement between the translation and the original Englishversion of this License, the original English version will prevail. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Documentexcept as expressly provided for under this License. Any otherattempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Documentis void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, orother functional and useful document ""free"" in the sense offreedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy andredistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commerciallyor noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for theauthor and publisher a way to get credit for their work, whilenot being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of ""copyleft"", which means thatderivative works of the document must themselves be free inthe same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals forfree software, because free software needs free documentation: a freeprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that thesoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter orwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Licenseprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder sayingit can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such anotice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited induration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.The ""Document"", below, refers to any such manual or work.Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as""you"". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distributethe work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A ""Modified Version"" of the Document means any work containingthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, orwith modifications and/or translated into another language. A ""Secondary Section"" is a named appendix or a front-mattersection of the Document that deals exclusively with therelationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to theDocument's overall subject (or to related matters) and containsnothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) Therelationship could be a matter of historical connection withthe subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The ""Invariant Sections"" are certain Secondary Sections whosetitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,in the notice that says that the Document is released underthis License. If a section does not fit the above definition ofSecondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Documentdoes not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The ""Cover Texts"" are certain short passages of text that are listed,as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says thatthe Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text maybe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A ""Transparent"" copy of the Document means a machine-readablecopy, represented in a format whose specification is availableto the general public, that is suitable for revising the documentstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed ofpixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely availabledrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters orfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for inputto text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent fileformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwartor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantialamount of text. A copy that is not ""Transparent"" is called ""Opaque"". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plainASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conformingsimple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be readand edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XMLfor which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generallyavailable, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDFproduced by some word processors for output purposes only. The ""Title Page"" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, thematerial this License requires to appear in the title page. Forworks in formats which do not have any title page as such, ""TitlePage"" means the text near the most prominent appearance of thework's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section ""Entitled XYZ"" means a named subunit of the Document whosetitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses followingtext that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands fora specific section name mentioned below, such as ""Acknowledgements"",""Dedications"", ""Endorsements"", or ""History"".) To ""Preserve theTitle"" of such a section when you modify the Document means thatit remains a section ""Entitled XYZ"" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the noticewhich states that this License applies to the Document. TheseWarranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by referencein this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers mayhave is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, eithercommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, thecopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License appliesto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add noother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may notuse technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or furthercopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may acceptcompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enoughnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditionsstated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonlyhave printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you mustenclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, andBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearlyand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. Thefront cover must present the full title with all words of the titleequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on thecovers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, aslong as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy theseconditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are toovoluminous to fit legibly, you should put the firstones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actualcover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Documentnumbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readableTransparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or witheach Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the generalnetwork-using public has access to download using public-standardnetwork protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must takereasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaquecopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy willremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least oneyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directlyor through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contactthe authors of the Document well before redistributingany large number of copies, to give them a chance toprovide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document underthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you releasethe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the ModifiedVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distributionand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copyof it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinctfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History sectionof the Document). You may use the same title as a previous versionif the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons orentities responsible for authorship of the modifications in theModified Version, together with at least five of the principalauthors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it hasfewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisherof the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for yourmodifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license noticegiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under theterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sectionsand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled ""History"", Preserve its Title, andadd to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the TitlePage. If there is no section Entitled ""History"" in the Document,create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisherof the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an itemdescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Documentfor public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, andlikewise the network locations given in the Document for previousversions it was based on. These may be placed in the ""History""section. You may omit a network location for a work that waspublished at least four years before the Document itself, or if theoriginal publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled ""Acknowledgements"" or ""Dedications"",Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in thesection all the substance and tone of each of the contributoracknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unalteredin their text and in their titles. Section numbers or theequivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled ""Endorsements"". Such asection may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ""Endorsements""or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections orappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no materialcopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some orall of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titlesto the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's licensenotice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled ""Endorsements"", providedit contains nothing but endorsements of your ModifiedVersion by various parties--for example, statements ofpeer review or that the text has been approved by anorganization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end ofthe list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passageof Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (orthrough arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document alreadyincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you orby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicitpermission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by thisLicense give permission to use their names for publicity foror to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released underthis License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modifiedversions, provided that you include in the combination all of theInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in itslicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, andmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a singlecopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same namebut different contents, make the title of each such section uniqueby adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the originalauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a uniquenumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the listof Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled""History"" in the various original documents, forming one sectionEntitled ""History""; likewise combine any sections Entitled""Acknowledgements"", and any sections Entitled ""Dedications"".You must delete all sections Entitled ""Endorsements"". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document andother documents released under this License, and replace theindividual copies of this License in the various documentswith a single copy that is included in the collection,provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatimcopying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection,and distribute it individually under this License,provided you insert a copy of this License into theextracted document, and follow this License in all otherrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with otherseparate and independent documents or works, in or on a volumeof a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate""if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used tolimit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond whatthe individual works permit. When the Document is included in anaggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in theaggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable tothese copies of the Document, then if the Document is lessthan one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's CoverTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Documentwithin the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of coversif the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they mustappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you maydistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires specialpermission from their copyright holders, but you may includetranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to theoriginal versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include atranslation of this License, and all the license notices in theDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you alsoinclude the original English version of this License and the originalversions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreementbetween the translation and the original version of this Licenseor a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled""Acknowledgements"", ""Dedications"", or ""History"", therequirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Documentexcept as expressly provided for under this License. Any otherattempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Documentis void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10.

If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same namebut different contents, make the title of each such section uniqueby adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the originalauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a uniquenumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the listof Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled""History"" in the various original documents, forming one sectionEntitled ""History""; likewise combine any sections Entitled""Acknowledgements"", and any sections Entitled ""Dedications"".You must delete all sections Entitled ""Endorsements"". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document andother documents released under this License, and replace theindividual copies of this License in the various documentswith a single copy that is included in the collection,provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatimcopying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection,and distribute it individually under this License,provided you insert a copy of this License into theextracted document, and follow this License in all otherrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with otherseparate and independent documents or works, in or on a volumeof a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate""if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used tolimit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond whatthe individual works permit. When the Document is included in anaggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in theaggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable tothese copies of the Document, then if the Document is lessthan one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's CoverTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Documentwithin the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of coversif the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they mustappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you maydistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires specialpermission from their copyright holders, but you may includetranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to theoriginal versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include atranslation of this License, and all the license notices in theDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you alsoinclude the original English version of this License and the originalversions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreementbetween the translation and the original version of this Licenseor a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled""Acknowledgements"", ""Dedications"", or ""History"", therequirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Documentexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminatethe licenses of parties who have received copies or rights fromyou under this License. If your rights have been terminated andnot permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or allof the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revisedversions of the GNU Free Documentation License from timeto time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit tothe present version, but may differ in detail to addressnew problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of thisLicense ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version orof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by theFree Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a versionnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (notas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifiesthat a proxy can decide which future versions of this License canbe used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a versionpermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING ""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site"" (or ""MMC Site"") means anyWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and alsoprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. Apublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration"" (or ""MMC"") contained in the sitemeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. ""CC-BY-SA"" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, anot-for-profit corporation with a principal place of businessin San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleftversions of that license published by that same organization. ""Incorporate"" means to publish or republish a Document,in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is ""eligible for relicensing"" if it is licensed under thisLicense, and if all works that were first published under this Licensesomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated inwhole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariantsections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained inthe site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time beforeAugust 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, orother functional and useful document ""free"" in the sense offreedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy andredistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commerciallyor noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for theauthor and publisher a way to get credit for their work, whilenot being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of ""copyleft"", which means thatderivative works of the document must themselves be free inthe same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals forfree software, because free software needs free documentation: a freeprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that thesoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter orwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Licenseprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder sayingit can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such anotice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited induration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.The ""Document"", below, refers to any such manual or work.Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as""you"". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distributethe work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A ""Modified Version"" of the Document means any work containingthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, orwith modifications and/or translated into another language. A ""Secondary Section"" is a named appendix or a front-mattersection of the Document that deals exclusively with therelationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to theDocument's overall subject (or to related matters) and containsnothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) Therelationship could be a matter of historical connection withthe subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The ""Invariant Sections"" are certain Secondary Sections whosetitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,in the notice that says that the Document is released underthis License. If a section does not fit the above definition ofSecondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Documentdoes not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The ""Cover Texts"" are certain short passages of text that are listed,as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says thatthe Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text maybe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A ""Transparent"" copy of the Document means a machine-readablecopy, represented in a format whose specification is availableto the general public, that is suitable for revising the documentstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed ofpixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely availabledrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters orfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for inputto text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent fileformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwartor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantialamount of text. A copy that is not ""Transparent"" is called ""Opaque"". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plainASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conformingsimple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be readand edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XMLfor which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generallyavailable, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDFproduced by some word processors for output purposes only. The ""Title Page"" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, thematerial this License requires to appear in the title page. Forworks in formats which do not have any title page as such, ""TitlePage"" means the text near the most prominent appearance of thework's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The ""publisher"" means any person or entity thatdistributes copies of the Document to the public. A section ""Entitled XYZ"" means a named subunit of the Document whosetitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses followingtext that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands fora specific section name mentioned below, such as ""Acknowledgements"",""Dedications"", ""Endorsements"", or ""History"".) To ""Preserve theTitle"" of such a section when you modify the Document means thatit remains a section ""Entitled XYZ"" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the noticewhich states that this License applies to the Document. TheseWarranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by referencein this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers mayhave is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, eithercommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, thecopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License appliesto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add noother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may notuse technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or furthercopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may acceptcompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enoughnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditionsstated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonlyhave printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you mustenclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, andBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearlyand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. Thefront cover must present the full title with all words of the titleequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on thecovers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, aslong as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy theseconditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are toovoluminous to fit legibly, you should put the firstones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actualcover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Documentnumbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readableTransparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or witheach Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the generalnetwork-using public has access to download using public-standardnetwork protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must takereasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaquecopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy willremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least oneyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directlyor through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contactthe authors of the Document well before redistributingany large number of copies, to give them a chance toprovide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document underthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you releasethe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the ModifiedVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distributionand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copyof it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinctfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History sectionof the Document). You may use the same title as a previous versionif the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons orentities responsible for authorship of the modifications in theModified Version, together with at least five of the principalauthors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it hasfewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisherof the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for yourmodifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license noticegiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under theterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of InvariantSections and required Cover Texts given in the Document'slicense notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled ""History"", Preserve its Title, andadd to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the TitlePage. If there is no section Entitled ""History"" in the Document,create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisherof the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an itemdescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Documentfor public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, andlikewise the network locations given in the Document for previousversions it was based on. These may be placed in the ""History""section. You may omit a network location for a work that waspublished at least four years before the Document itself, or if theoriginal publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled ""Acknowledgements"" or ""Dedications"",Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in thesection all the substance and tone of each of the contributoracknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unalteredin their text and in their titles. Section numbers or theequivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled ""Endorsements"". Such asection may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ""Endorsements""or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections orappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no materialcopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some orall of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titlesto the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's licensenotice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled ""Endorsements"", providedit contains nothing but endorsements of your ModifiedVersion by various parties--for example, statements ofpeer review or that the text has been approved by anorganization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end ofthe list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passageof Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (orthrough arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document alreadyincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you orby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicitpermission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by thisLicense give permission to use their names for publicity foror to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released underthis License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modifiedversions, provided that you include in the combination all of theInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in itslicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, andmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a singlecopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same namebut different contents, make the title of each such section uniqueby adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the originalauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a uniquenumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the listof Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled""History"" in the various original documents, forming one sectionEntitled ""History""; likewise combine any sections Entitled""Acknowledgements"", and any sections Entitled ""Dedications"".You must delete all sections Entitled ""Endorsements"". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document andother documents released under this License, and replace theindividual copies of this License in the various documentswith a single copy that is included in the collection,provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatimcopying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection,and distribute it individually under this License,provided you insert a copy of this License into theextracted document, and follow this License in all otherrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with otherseparate and independent documents or works, in or on a volumeof a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate""if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used tolimit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond whatthe individual works permit. When the Document is included in anaggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in theaggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable tothese copies of the Document, then if the Document is lessthan one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's CoverTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Documentwithin the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of coversif the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they mustappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you maydistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires specialpermission from their copyright holders, but you may includetranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to theoriginal versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include atranslation of this License, and all the license notices in theDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you alsoinclude the original English version of this License and the originalversions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreementbetween the translation and the original version of this Licenseor a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled""Acknowledgements"", ""Dedications"", or ""History"", therequirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Documentexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminatethe licenses of parties who have received copies or rights fromyou under this License. If your rights have been terminated andnot permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or allof the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revisedversions of the GNU Free Documentation License from timeto time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit tothe present version, but may differ in detail to addressnew problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of thisLicense ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version orof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by theFree Software Foundation.

RELICENSING ""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site"" (or ""MMC Site"") means anyWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and alsoprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. Apublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration"" (or ""MMC"") contained in the sitemeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedomto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License isintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--tomake sure the software is free for all its users. This General PublicLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's softwareand to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some otherFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you havethe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can getit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender therights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that youhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright thesoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to makecertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty forthis free software. If the software is modified by someone elseand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what theyhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced byothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free programwill individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the programproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patentmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains anotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this General Public License. The ""Program"", below,refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into anotherlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitationin the term ""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The actof running the Program is not restricted, and the output from theProgram is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Program (independent of having been made by running theProgram). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's sourcecode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright noticeand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer tothis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any otherrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,that in whole or in part contains or is derived from theProgram or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactivelywhen run, you must cause it, when started running for suchinteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or displayan announcement including an appropriate copyright notice anda notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that youprovide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the programunder these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copyof this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactivebut does not normally print such an announcement, your workbased on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Program, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Program with the Program (or with a work based on theProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms ofSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable sourcecode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least threeyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than yourcost of physically performing source distribution, a completemachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, tobe distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 aboveon a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offerto distribute corresponding source code. (This alternativeis allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only ifyou received the program in object code or executable formwith such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, completesource code means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the executable.However, as a special exception, the source code distributedneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in eithersource or binary form) with the major components (compiler,kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offeringaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalentaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts asdistribution of the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Programexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Programis void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. Theseactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or anywork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of thisLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on theProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject tothese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictionson the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are notresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid orunenforceable under any particular circumstance, thebalance of the section is intended to apply and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringeany patents or other property right claims or to contestvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purposeof protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem, which is implemented by public license practices. Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range ofsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistentapplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor todecide if he or she is willing to distribute software throughany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what isbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the original copyright holder who places the Program under thisLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitationexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies a version number of this License which appliesto it and ""any later version"", you have the option of followingthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any laterversion published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Programdoes not specify a version number of this License, you may chooseany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to theauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by theFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPTWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHERPARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/ORREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIALDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDEREDINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OFTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. < one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. > Copyright (C) < yyyy > < name of author > This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenseas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedomto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License isintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--tomake sure the software is free for all its users. This General PublicLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's softwareand to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some otherFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you havethe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can getit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender therights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that youhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright thesoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to makecertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty forthis free software. If the software is modified by someone elseand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what theyhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced byothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free programwill individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the programproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patentmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains anotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this General Public License. The ""Program"", below,refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into anotherlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitationin the term ""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The actof running the Program is not restricted, and the output from theProgram is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Program (independent of having been made by running theProgram). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's sourcecode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright noticeand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer tothis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any otherrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,that in whole or in part contains or is derived from theProgram or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactivelywhen run, you must cause it, when started running for suchinteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or displayan announcement including an appropriate copyright notice anda notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that youprovide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the programunder these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copyof this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactivebut does not normally print such an announcement, your workbased on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Program, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Program with the Program (or with a work based on theProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms ofSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable sourcecode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least threeyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than yourcost of physically performing source distribution, a completemachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, tobe distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 aboveon a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offerto distribute corresponding source code.

492,GPL-3.0-only,GNU General Public License v3.0 only,"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleftlicense for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed totake away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNUGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share andchange all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free softwarefor all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU GeneralPublic License for most of our software; it applies also to any other workreleased this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, orif you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms thatyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearlyexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. Forboth users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modifiedversions be marked as changed, so that their problems willnot be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modifiedversions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer cando so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protectingusers' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern ofsuch abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we havedesigned this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in futureversions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wishto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free programcould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPLassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that applyto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed underthis License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees""and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of thework in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than themaking of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modifiedversion"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodifiedProgram or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing iton a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includescopying, distribution (with or without modification), making availableto the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagationthat enables other parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through a computernetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except tothe extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may conveythe work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferredform of the work for making modifications to it.""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the caseof interfaces specified for a particular programming language,one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal formof packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form. A""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means allthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executablework) run the object code and to modify the work, including scriptsto control those activities. However, it does not include the work'sSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally availablefree programs which are used unmodified in performing those activitiesbut which are not part of the work. For example, CorrespondingSource includes interface definition files associated with sourcefiles for the work, and the source code for shared librariesand dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specificallydesigned to require, such as by intimate data communication orcontrol flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users canregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a workin source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of havingthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you withfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copiesof your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permittedsolely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensingis not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power toforbid circumvention of technological measures to the extentsuch circumvention is effected by exercising rights under thisLicense with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim anyintention to limit operation or modification of the work as a meansof enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code asyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyrightnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to thecode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; andgive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that youconvey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the termsof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices statingthat you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating thatit is released under this License and any conditionsadded under section 7. This requirement modifies therequirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this Licenseto anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This Licensewill therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives nopermission to license the work in any other way, but it does notinvalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each mustdisplay Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Programhas interactive interfaces that do not display AppropriateLegal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the coveredwork, and which are not combined with it such as to form a largerprogram, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resultingcopyright are not used to limit the access or legal rightsof the compilation's users beyond what the individual workspermit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does notcause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code formunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that youalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Sourceunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physicalproduct (including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by awritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid foras long as you offer spare parts or customer support for thatproduct model, to give anyone who possesses the object codeeither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the softwarein the product that is covered by this License, on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange,for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physicallyperforming this conveying of source, or (2) access to copythe Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with acopy of the written offer to provide the CorrespondingSource. This alternative is allowed only occasionallyand noncommercially, and only if you received the objectcode with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to theCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place atno further charge. You need not require recipients to copy theCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the placeto copy the object code is a network server, the CorrespondingSource may be on a different server (operated by you or a thirdparty) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided youmaintain clear directions next to the object code saying whereto find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hoststhe Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that itis available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,provided you inform other peers where the object codeand Corresponding Source of the work are being offeredto the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code isexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which meansany tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or soldfor incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a productis a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favorof coverage. For a particular product received by a particularuser, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of thatclass of product, regardless of the status of the particularuser or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is aconsumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such usesrepresent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information requiredto install and execute modified versions of a covered work inthat User Product from a modified version of its CorrespondingSource. The information must suffice to ensure that the continuedfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case preventedor interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveyingoccurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possessionand use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient inperpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transactionis characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under thissection must be accompanied by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any thirdparty retains the ability to install modified object code on theUser Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does notinclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,warranty, or updates for a work that has been modifiedor installed by the recipient, or for the User Product inwhich it has been modified or installed. Access to a networkmay be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violatesthe rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Informationprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format thatis publicly documented (and with an implementation availableto the public in source code form), and must require nospecial password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Programshall be treated as though they were included in this License, tothe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additionalpermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be usedseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remainsgoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any partof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holdersof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differentlyfrom the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legalnotices or author attributions in that material or in theAppropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,or requiring that modified versions of such material be markedin reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of namesof licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for useof some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of thatmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modifiedversions of it) with contractual assumptions of liabilityto the recipient, for any liability that these contractualassumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""furtherrestrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Programas you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice statingthat it is governed by this License along with a term that isa further restriction, you may remove that term. If a licensedocument contains a further restriction but permits relicensing orconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work materialgoverned by the terms of that license document, provided that thefurther restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with thissection, you must place, in the relevant source files, astatement of the additional terms that apply to those files,or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may bestated in the form of a separately written license, or statedas exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except asexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwiseto propagate or modify it is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License (including any patentlicenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does notterminate the licenses of parties who have received copies orrights from you under this License. If your rights have beenterminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualifyto receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagateor modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if youdo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control ofan organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividingan organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of acovered work results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, youmay not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exerciseof rights granted under this License, and you may not initiatelitigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patentclaims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether alreadyacquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by somemanner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or sellingits contributor version, but do not include claims that wouldbe infringed only as a consequence of further modificationof the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is anyexpress agreement or commitment, however denominated, not toenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practicea patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such anagreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyoneto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, througha publicly available network server or other readily accessiblemeans, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source tobe so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefitof the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extendthe patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying""means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, yourconveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use ofthe covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiablepatents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyanceof, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of theparties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,then the patent license you grant is automatically extendedto all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within thescope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditionedon the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specificallygranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work ifyou are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in thebusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment tothe third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding orlimiting any implied license or other defenses to infringementthat may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. Ifyou cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneouslyyour obligations under this License and any other pertinentobligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collecta royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey theProgram, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensedunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License intoa single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. Theterms of this License will continue to apply to the part whichis the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNUAffero General Public License, section 13, concerning interactionthrough a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNUGeneral Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it,you have the option of following the terms and conditions eitherof that numbered version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify aversion number of the GNU General Public License, you may chooseany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, thatproxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanentlyauthorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional ordifferent permissions. However, no additional obligationsare imposed on any author or copyright holder as aresult of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BYAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHTHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUTWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOTLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FORA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCEOF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/ORCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGESARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDINGBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATEOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THEPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liabilityprovided above cannot be given local legal effect according totheir terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that mostclosely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability inconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption ofliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name anda brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenseas published by the Free Software Foundation, either version3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will beuseful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the impliedwarranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General	Public License along with this program. If not, see	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output ashort notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: 	<program> Copyright (C) <year>	<name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NOWARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistributeit under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' shouldshow the appropriate parts of the General Public License.Of course, your program's commands might be different;for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as aprogrammer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer""for the program, if necessary. For more information on	this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporatingyour program into proprietary programs. If your program is asubroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permitlinking proprietary applications with the library. If thisis what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public	License instead of this License.

853,GPL-3.0-or-later,GNU General Public License v3.0 or later,"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleftlicense for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed totake away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNUGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share andchange all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free softwarefor all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU GeneralPublic License for most of our software; it applies also to any other workreleased this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, orif you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms thatyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearlyexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. Forboth users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modifiedversions be marked as changed, so that their problems willnot be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modifiedversions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer cando so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protectingusers' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern ofsuch abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we havedesigned this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in futureversions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wishto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free programcould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPLassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that applyto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed underthis License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees""and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of thework in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than themaking of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modifiedversion"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodifiedProgram or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing iton a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includescopying, distribution (with or without modification), making availableto the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagationthat enables other parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through a computernetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except tothe extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may conveythe work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferredform of the work for making modifications to it.""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the caseof interfaces specified for a particular programming language,one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal formof packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form. A""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means allthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executablework) run the object code and to modify the work, including scriptsto control those activities. However, it does not include the work'sSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally availablefree programs which are used unmodified in performing those activitiesbut which are not part of the work. For example, CorrespondingSource includes interface definition files associated with sourcefiles for the work, and the source code for shared librariesand dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specificallydesigned to require, such as by intimate data communication orcontrol flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users canregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a workin source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of havingthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you withfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copiesof your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permittedsolely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensingis not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power toforbid circumvention of technological measures to the extentsuch circumvention is effected by exercising rights under thisLicense with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim anyintention to limit operation or modification of the work as a meansof enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code asyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyrightnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to thecode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; andgive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that youconvey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the termsof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices statingthat you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating thatit is released under this License and any conditionsadded under section 7. This requirement modifies therequirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this Licenseto anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This Licensewill therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives nopermission to license the work in any other way, but it does notinvalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each mustdisplay Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Programhas interactive interfaces that do not display AppropriateLegal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the coveredwork, and which are not combined with it such as to form a largerprogram, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resultingcopyright are not used to limit the access or legal rightsof the compilation's users beyond what the individual workspermit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does notcause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code formunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that youalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Sourceunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physicalproduct (including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by awritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid foras long as you offer spare parts or customer support for thatproduct model, to give anyone who possesses the object codeeither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the softwarein the product that is covered by this License, on a durablephysical medium customarily used for software interchange,for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physicallyperforming this conveying of source, or (2) access to copythe Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with acopy of the written offer to provide the CorrespondingSource. This alternative is allowed only occasionallyand noncommercially, and only if you received the objectcode with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to theCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place atno further charge. You need not require recipients to copy theCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the placeto copy the object code is a network server, the CorrespondingSource may be on a different server (operated by you or a thirdparty) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided youmaintain clear directions next to the object code saying whereto find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hoststhe Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that itis available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,provided you inform other peers where the object codeand Corresponding Source of the work are being offeredto the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code isexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which meansany tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or soldfor incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a productis a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favorof coverage. For a particular product received by a particularuser, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of thatclass of product, regardless of the status of the particularuser or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is aconsumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such usesrepresent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information requiredto install and execute modified versions of a covered work inthat User Product from a modified version of its CorrespondingSource. The information must suffice to ensure that the continuedfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case preventedor interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveyingoccurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possessionand use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient inperpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transactionis characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under thissection must be accompanied by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any thirdparty retains the ability to install modified object code on theUser Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does notinclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,warranty, or updates for a work that has been modifiedor installed by the recipient, or for the User Product inwhich it has been modified or installed. Access to a networkmay be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violatesthe rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Informationprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format thatis publicly documented (and with an implementation availableto the public in source code form), and must require nospecial password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Programshall be treated as though they were included in this License, tothe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additionalpermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be usedseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remainsgoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any partof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holdersof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differentlyfrom the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legalnotices or author attributions in that material or in theAppropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,or requiring that modified versions of such material be markedin reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of namesof licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for useof some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of thatmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modifiedversions of it) with contractual assumptions of liabilityto the recipient, for any liability that these contractualassumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""furtherrestrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Programas you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice statingthat it is governed by this License along with a term that isa further restriction, you may remove that term. If a licensedocument contains a further restriction but permits relicensing orconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work materialgoverned by the terms of that license document, provided that thefurther restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with thissection, you must place, in the relevant source files, astatement of the additional terms that apply to those files,or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may bestated in the form of a separately written license, or statedas exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except asexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwiseto propagate or modify it is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License (including any patentlicenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitlyand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, ifthe copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation bysome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies youof the violation by some reasonable means, this is the firsttime you have received notice of violation of this License(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure theviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does notterminate the licenses of parties who have received copies orrights from you under this License. If your rights have beenterminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualifyto receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagateor modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if youdo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control ofan organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividingan organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of acovered work results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, youmay not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exerciseof rights granted under this License, and you may not initiatelitigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patentclaims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether alreadyacquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by somemanner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or sellingits contributor version, but do not include claims that wouldbe infringed only as a consequence of further modificationof the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is anyexpress agreement or commitment, however denominated, not toenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practicea patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such anagreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyoneto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, througha publicly available network server or other readily accessiblemeans, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source tobe so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefitof the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, ina manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extendthe patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying""means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, yourconveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use ofthe covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiablepatents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyanceof, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of theparties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,then the patent license you grant is automatically extendedto all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within thescope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditionedon the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specificallygranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work ifyou are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in thebusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment tothe third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding orlimiting any implied license or other defenses to infringementthat may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. Ifyou cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneouslyyour obligations under this License and any other pertinentobligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collecta royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey theProgram, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensedunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License intoa single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. Theterms of this License will continue to apply to the part whichis the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNUAffero General Public License, section 13, concerning interactionthrough a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNUGeneral Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it,you have the option of following the terms and conditions eitherof that numbered version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify aversion number of the GNU General Public License, you may chooseany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, thatproxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanentlyauthorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional ordifferent permissions. However, no additional obligationsare imposed on any author or copyright holder as aresult of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BYAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHTHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUTWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOTLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FORA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCEOF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/ORCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGESARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDINGBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATEOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THEPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liabilityprovided above cannot be given local legal effect according totheir terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that mostclosely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability inconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption ofliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name anda brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenseas published by the Free Software Foundation, either version3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General	Public License along with this program. If not, see	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output ashort notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: 	<program> Copyright (C) <year>	<name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NOWARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistributeit under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' shouldshow the appropriate parts of the General Public License.Of course, your program's commands might be different;for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as aprogrammer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer""for the program, if necessary.

Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do. The Unix configuration script ""configure"" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable. It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code. The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce ""uncompressed GIFs"". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders. We are required to state that ""The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.""",,False,N,N,False

""Original Program"" means the original version of the softwareaccompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including sourcecode, object code and documentation, if any. ""Program"" means the Original Program and Contributions. ""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under thisAgreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor herebygrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyrightlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of suchContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code andobject code form. b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor herebygrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patentlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,if any, in source code and object code form. This patent licenseshall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Programif, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, suchaddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered bythe Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to anyother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware perse is licensed hereunder. c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distributethe Program in object code form under its own license agreement,provided that: a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b. its license agreement: i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warrantiesand conditions, express and implied, including warranties orconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties orconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liabilityfor damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental andconsequential damages, such as lost profits; iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement areoffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv. states that source code for the Program is available from suchContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonablemanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originatorof its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allowssubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certainresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and thelike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercialuse of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in acommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does notcreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if aContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defendand indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"")against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arisingfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a thirdparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by theacts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection withits distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Lossesrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptlynotify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with theCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlementnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in anysuch claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercialproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a CommercialContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performanceclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performanceclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor'sresponsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributorwould have to defend claims against the other Contributors related tothose performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires anyother Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the CommercialContributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM ISPROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANYWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITYOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solelyresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using anddistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with itsexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited tothe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicablelaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, andunavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENTNOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ONANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, ORTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OFTHE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTSGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable underapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability ofthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without furtheraction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to theminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor withrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claimor counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted bythat Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shallterminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, ifRecipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (includinga cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Programitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software orhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient'srights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date suchlitigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if itfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of thisAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period oftime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient'srights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease useand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and anylicenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continueand survive. IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreementfrom time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given adistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreementunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of theAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute theProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. No oneother than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except asexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receivesno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributorunder this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel orotherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted underthis Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York andthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. Noparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under thisAgreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.

869,LGPL-2.0-only,GNU Library General Public License v2 only,"GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It isnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, appliesto some specially designated Free Software Foundationsoftware, and to any other libraries whose authorsdecide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you havethe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can getit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender therights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that wegave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. If you link a program with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink themwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyrightthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives youlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certainthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for thisfree library. If the library is modified by someone else andpassed on, we want its recipients to know that what they haveis not the original version, so that any problems introduced byothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by softwarepatents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributingfree software will individually obtain patent licenses, thusin effect transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent mustbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utilityprograms. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quitedifferent from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don'tassume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries isthat they blur the distinction we usually make between modifyingor adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program witha library, without changing the library, is in some sense simplyusing the library, and is analogous to running a utility programor application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, thelinked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the originallibrary, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary GeneralPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote softwaresharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. Weconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive theusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of thelibraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intendedto permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, whilepreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the freelibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how toachieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achievedit as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) Thehope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distributionand modification follow. Pay close attention to the differencebetween a ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that usesthe library"". The former contains code derived from thelibrary, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by theordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software librarywhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed underthe terms of this Library General Public License (alsocalled ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based onthe Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translationis included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For a library, complete sourcecode means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and outputfrom such a program is covered only if its contents constitute awork based on the Library (independent of the use of the Libraryin a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on whatthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's completesource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that youconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriatecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all thenotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a functionor a table of data to be supplied by an application programthat uses the facility, other than as an argument passedwhen the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faitheffort to ensure that, in the event an application does notsupply such function or table, the facility still operates,and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square rootshas a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent ofthe application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this functionmust be optional: if the application does not supply it,the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theLibrary, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Library, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Library with the Library (or with a work based on theLibrary) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of theLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that referto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If anewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version insteadif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies toall subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of thecode of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivativeof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form underthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copythe source code from the same place satisfies the requirementto distribute the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiledor linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"".Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of theLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (becauseit contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that usesthe library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a headerfile that is part of the Library, the object code for the work maybe a derivative work of the Library even though the source code isnot. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work canbe linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of theobject file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legallya derivative work. (Executables containing this object codeplus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile orlink a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to producea work containing portions of the Library, and distributethat work under terms of your choice, provided that the termspermit modification of the work for the customer's own useand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the workthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and itsuse are covered by this License. You must supply a copy ofthis License. If the work during execution displays copyrightnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Libraryamong them, as well as a reference directing the user to thecopy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code for the Library including whatever changes were used inthe work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with thecomplete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", as objectcode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Libraryand then relink to produce a modified executable containing themodified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes thecontents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily beable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge nomore than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access tocopy from a designated place, offer equivalent access tocopy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that usesthe Library"" must include any data and utility programs neededfor reproducing the executable from it. However, as a specialexception, the source code distributed need not includeanything that is normally distributed (in either source orbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts thelicense restrictions of other proprietary libraries thatdo not normally accompany the operating system. Sucha contradiction means you cannot use both them and theLibrary together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such acombined library, provided that the separate distribution of thework based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work basedon the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute theLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rightsunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. Theseactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or anywork based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of thisLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based onthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a licensefrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with ormodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. Youmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid orunenforceable under any particular circumstance, thebalance of the section is intended to apply, and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringeany patents or other property right claims or to contestvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purposeof protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem which is implemented by public license practices. Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range ofsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistentapplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor todecide if he or she is willing to distribute software throughany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what isbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the original copyright holder who places the Library under thisLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitationexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the Library General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Ifthe Library specifies a version number of this License whichapplies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that version or ofany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. Ifthe Library does not specify a license version number, you maychoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programswhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write tothe author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted bythe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPTWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHERPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/ORREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIALDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDEREDINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OFTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free softwarethat everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so bypermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to thelibrary. It is safest to attach them to the start of eachsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion ofwarranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright""line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the library's nameand an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year name of author This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; eitherversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warrantyof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You should have received a copy of the GNU LibraryGeneral Public License along with this library; ifnot, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)or your school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" forthe library, if necessary.

870,LGPL-2.0-or-later,GNU Library General Public License v2 or later,"GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It isnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, appliesto some specially designated Free Software Foundationsoftware, and to any other libraries whose authorsdecide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you havethe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can getit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender therights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that wegave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. If you link a program with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink themwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyrightthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives youlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certainthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for thisfree library. If the library is modified by someone else andpassed on, we want its recipients to know that what they haveis not the original version, so that any problems introduced byothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by softwarepatents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributingfree software will individually obtain patent licenses, thusin effect transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent mustbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utilityprograms. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quitedifferent from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don'tassume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries isthat they blur the distinction we usually make between modifyingor adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program witha library, without changing the library, is in some sense simplyusing the library, and is analogous to running a utility programor application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, thelinked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the originallibrary, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary GeneralPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote softwaresharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. Weconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive theusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of thelibraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intendedto permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, whilepreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the freelibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how toachieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achievedit as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) Thehope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distributionand modification follow. Pay close attention to the differencebetween a ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that usesthe library"". The former contains code derived from thelibrary, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by theordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software librarywhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed underthe terms of this Library General Public License (alsocalled ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based onthe Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translationis included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For a library, complete sourcecode means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and outputfrom such a program is covered only if its contents constitute awork based on the Library (independent of the use of the Libraryin a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on whatthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's completesource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that youconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriatecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all thenotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a functionor a table of data to be supplied by an application programthat uses the facility, other than as an argument passedwhen the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faitheffort to ensure that, in the event an application does notsupply such function or table, the facility still operates,and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square rootshas a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent ofthe application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this functionmust be optional: if the application does not supply it,the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theLibrary, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Library, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Library with the Library (or with a work based on theLibrary) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of theLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that referto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If anewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version insteadif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies toall subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of thecode of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivativeof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form underthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copythe source code from the same place satisfies the requirementto distribute the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiledor linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"".Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of theLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (becauseit contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that usesthe library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a headerfile that is part of the Library, the object code for the work maybe a derivative work of the Library even though the source code isnot. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work canbe linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of theobject file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legallya derivative work. (Executables containing this object codeplus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile orlink a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to producea work containing portions of the Library, and distributethat work under terms of your choice, provided that the termspermit modification of the work for the customer's own useand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the workthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and itsuse are covered by this License. You must supply a copy ofthis License. If the work during execution displays copyrightnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Libraryamong them, as well as a reference directing the user to thecopy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code for the Library including whatever changes were used inthe work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with thecomplete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", as objectcode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Libraryand then relink to produce a modified executable containing themodified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes thecontents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily beable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge nomore than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access tocopy from a designated place, offer equivalent access tocopy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that usesthe Library"" must include any data and utility programs neededfor reproducing the executable from it. However, as a specialexception, the source code distributed need not includeanything that is normally distributed (in either source orbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts thelicense restrictions of other proprietary libraries thatdo not normally accompany the operating system. Sucha contradiction means you cannot use both them and theLibrary together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such acombined library, provided that the separate distribution of thework based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work basedon the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute theLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rightsunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. Theseactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or anywork based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of thisLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based onthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a licensefrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with ormodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. Youmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid orunenforceable under any particular circumstance, thebalance of the section is intended to apply, and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringeany patents or other property right claims or to contestvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purposeof protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem which is implemented by public license practices. Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range ofsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistentapplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor todecide if he or she is willing to distribute software throughany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what isbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the original copyright holder who places the Library under thisLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitationexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the Library General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Ifthe Library specifies a version number of this License whichapplies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that version or ofany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. Ifthe Library does not specify a license version number, you maychoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programswhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write tothe author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted bythe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPTWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHERPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/ORREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIALDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDEREDINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OFTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free softwarethat everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so bypermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to thelibrary. It is safest to attach them to the start of eachsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion ofwarranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright""line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the library's nameand an idea of what it does.

386,LGPL-2.1-only,GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 only,"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts as the successor of the GNU LibraryPublic License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it ifyou want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in newfree programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrenderthese rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilitiesfor you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that wegave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyrightthe library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives youlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that thereis no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modifiedby someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what theyhave is not the original version, so that the original author's reputationwill not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existenceof any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered bythe ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNULesser General Public License, applies to certain designatedlibraries, and is quite different from the ordinary GeneralPublic License. We use this license for certain libraries inorder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entirecombination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General PublicLicense permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public Licensebecause it does Less to protect the user's freedom than theordinary General Public License. It also provides other freesoftware developers Less of an advantage over competing non-freeprograms. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinaryGeneral Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesserlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so thatit becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programsmust be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that afree library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free libraryto free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of freesoftware. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-freeprograms enables many more people to use the whole GNU operatingsystem, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective ofthe users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program thatis linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithalto run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference betweena ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"".The former contains code derived from the library, whereasthe latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library orother program which contains a notice placed by the copyrightholder or other authorized party saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this Lesser General Public License (alsocalled ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based onthe Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translationis included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For a library, complete sourcecode means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and outputfrom such a program is covered only if its contents constitute awork based on the Library (independent of the use of the Libraryin a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on whatthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's completesource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that youconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriatecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all thenotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a functionor a table of data to be supplied by an application programthat uses the facility, other than as an argument passedwhen the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faitheffort to ensure that, in the event an application does notsupply such function or table, the facility still operates,and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square rootshas a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent ofthe application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this functionmust be optional: if the application does not supply it,the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theLibrary, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Library, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Library with the Library (or with a work based on theLibrary) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of theLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that referto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If anewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version insteadif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies toall subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of thecode of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivativeof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form underthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copythe source code from the same place satisfies the requirementto distribute the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiledor linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"".Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of theLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (becauseit contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that usesthe library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a headerfile that is part of the Library, the object code for the work maybe a derivative work of the Library even though the source code isnot. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work canbe linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of theobject file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legallya derivative work. (Executables containing this object codeplus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to producea work containing portions of the Library, and distributethat work under terms of your choice, provided that the termspermit modification of the work for the customer's own useand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the workthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and itsuse are covered by this License. You must supply a copy ofthis License. If the work during execution displays copyrightnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Libraryamong them, as well as a reference directing the user to thecopy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code for the Library including whatever changes were used inthe work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with thecomplete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", as objectcode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Libraryand then relink to produce a modified executable containing themodified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes thecontents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily beable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with theLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time acopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,rather than copying library functions into the executable, and(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library,if the user installs one, as long as the modified version isinterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge nomore than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access tocopy from a designated place, offer equivalent access tocopy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that usesthe Library"" must include any data and utility programs neededfor reproducing the executable from it. However, as a specialexception, the materials to be distributed need not includeanything that is normally distributed (in either source orbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts thelicense restrictions of other proprietary libraries thatdo not normally accompany the operating system. Sucha contradiction means you cannot use both them and theLibrary together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such acombined library, provided that the separate distribution of thework based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work basedon the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute theLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rightsunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. Theseactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or anywork based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of thisLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based onthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a licensefrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with ormodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. Youmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid orunenforceable under any particular circumstance, thebalance of the section is intended to apply, and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringeany patents or other property right claims or to contestvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purposeof protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem which is implemented by public license practices. Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range ofsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistentapplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor todecide if he or she is willing to distribute software throughany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what isbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the original copyright holder who places the Library under thisLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitationexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Ifthe Library specifies a version number of this License whichapplies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that version or ofany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. Ifthe Library does not specify a license version number, you maychoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programswhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write tothe author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted bythe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPTWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHERPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/ORREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIALDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDEREDINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OFTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free softwarethat everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so bypermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to thelibrary. It is safest to attach them to the start of eachsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion ofwarranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright""line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 	 < one line to give the library's name	and an idea of what it does. > Copyright (C) < year > < name of author > This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; eitherversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

871,LGPL-2.1-or-later,GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later,"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts as the successor of the GNU LibraryPublic License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it ifyou want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in newfree programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrenderthese rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilitiesfor you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that wegave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code. If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyrightthe library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives youlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that thereis no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modifiedby someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what theyhave is not the original version, so that the original author's reputationwill not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existenceof any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered bythe ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNULesser General Public License, applies to certain designatedlibraries, and is quite different from the ordinary GeneralPublic License. We use this license for certain libraries inorder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entirecombination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General PublicLicense permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public Licensebecause it does Less to protect the user's freedom than theordinary General Public License. It also provides other freesoftware developers Less of an advantage over competing non-freeprograms. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinaryGeneral Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesserlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so thatit becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programsmust be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that afree library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free libraryto free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of freesoftware. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-freeprograms enables many more people to use the whole GNU operatingsystem, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective ofthe users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program thatis linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithalto run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference betweena ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"".The former contains code derived from the library, whereasthe latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library orother program which contains a notice placed by the copyrightholder or other authorized party saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this Lesser General Public License (alsocalled ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based onthe Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translationis included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For a library, complete sourcecode means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and outputfrom such a program is covered only if its contents constitute awork based on the Library (independent of the use of the Libraryin a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on whatthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's completesource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that youconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriatecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all thenotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a functionor a table of data to be supplied by an application programthat uses the facility, other than as an argument passedwhen the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faitheffort to ensure that, in the event an application does notsupply such function or table, the facility still operates,and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square rootshas a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent ofthe application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this functionmust be optional: if the application does not supply it,the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theLibrary, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Library, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Library with the Library (or with a work based on theLibrary) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of theLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that referto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU GeneralPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If anewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version insteadif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies toall subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of thecode of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivativeof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form underthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copythe source code from the same place satisfies the requirementto distribute the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiledor linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"".Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of theLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (becauseit contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that usesthe library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a headerfile that is part of the Library, the object code for the work maybe a derivative work of the Library even though the source code isnot. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work canbe linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of theobject file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legallya derivative work. (Executables containing this object codeplus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to producea work containing portions of the Library, and distributethat work under terms of your choice, provided that the termspermit modification of the work for the customer's own useand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the workthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and itsuse are covered by this License. You must supply a copy ofthis License. If the work during execution displays copyrightnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Libraryamong them, as well as a reference directing the user to thecopy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code for the Library including whatever changes were used inthe work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with thecomplete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", as objectcode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Libraryand then relink to produce a modified executable containing themodified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes thecontents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily beable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with theLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time acopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,rather than copying library functions into the executable, and(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library,if the user installs one, as long as the modified version isinterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge nomore than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access tocopy from a designated place, offer equivalent access tocopy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that usesthe Library"" must include any data and utility programs neededfor reproducing the executable from it. However, as a specialexception, the materials to be distributed need not includeanything that is normally distributed (in either source orbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts thelicense restrictions of other proprietary libraries thatdo not normally accompany the operating system. Sucha contradiction means you cannot use both them and theLibrary together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such acombined library, provided that the separate distribution of thework based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work basedon the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute theLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rightsunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based onthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a licensefrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with ormodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. Youmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Ifthe Library specifies a version number of this License whichapplies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option offollowing the terms and conditions either of that version or ofany later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

A Contribution is ""Contributed"" by a Contributor only (i) if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. ""Contributor"" means <OWNER> and any other entity that hasContributed a Contribution to the Program. ""Distributor"" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof. ""Licensed Patents"" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. ""Original Program"" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by <OWNER> , including source code, object code anddocumentation, if any. ""Program"" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof ""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that: 1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 2. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and 3. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement: a. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; b. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and c. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its additions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (""Commercial Distributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages. 5.

GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. <OWNER> may publish new versions (including revisions) of thisAgreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing versionnumber.

883,LPPL-1.2,LaTeX Project Public License v1.2,"The LaTeX Project Public License =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- LPPL Version 1.2 1999-09-03 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed. PREAMBLE ======== The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed. You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. In this license document, `The Program' refers to any program distributed under this license. This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted. We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION =========================================== You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed. You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file. You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met: 1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program'. 2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'. 3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file. 4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it. 5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program. 6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files. 7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file. 8. You must do either (A) or (B): (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file; (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version). Note that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification' of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. Changing the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file conventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a modification of the file. The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program. A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution ----------------------------------------------------- It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files. Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program -------------------------------------------------------- An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files. Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files --------------------------------------------- If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension: - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate. - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that: (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts; (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX). - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg' (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file. Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license. NO WARRANTY =========== There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE ========================================================= This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section. Choosing This License or Another License ---------------------------------------- If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL. The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it. How to Use This License ----------------------- To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license. Here is an example of such a notice and statement: %% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name % % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2 % of this license or (at your option) any later version. % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 1999/12/01 or later. % % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program' referring to the two files `pig.dtx' and `pig.ins', and `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'. Important Recommendations ------------------------- Defining What Constitutes The Program The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt. in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program. Noting Exceptional Files If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files. Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.","%% pig.dtx%% Copyright 2001 M. Y.

PREAMBLE ======== The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed. You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed. We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. DEFINITIONS =========== In this license document the following terms are used: `Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work. `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law. `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS). `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work. `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law. `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a ""LaTeX-Format"". CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION =========================================== 1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work. 2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause. 3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work. 4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work. 5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work. 6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work. a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter. b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes. c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work. d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work: 1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component; 2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work. 7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work. 8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above. 9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process. 10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license. b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work. 11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means. 12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws. NO WARRANTY =========== There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK ======================= The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that is `author-maintained'. The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports. The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance. You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role. If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps: 1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search. 2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained. a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data within one month. b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.) 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. 4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer. 5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month. A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license. If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above. WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE ====================================================== This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section. Choosing This License or Another License ---------------------------------------- If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL. The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it. A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution ----------------------------------------------------- It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components. How to Use This License ----------------------- To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license. Here is an example of such a notice and statement: %% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name % % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 % of this license or (at your option) any later version. % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 2003/12/01 or later. % % This work has the LPPL maintenance status "" maintained "". % % This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name . % % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file pig.sty . Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any ""LaTeX-Format"", and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'. If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change ""maintained"" above into ""author-maintained"". However, we recommend that you use ""maintained"" as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself. Important Recommendations ------------------------- Defining What Constitutes the Work The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt. in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.","%% pig.dtx%% Copyright 2003 M.

In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work. 2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause. 3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work. 4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work. 5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work. 6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work. a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter. b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes. c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work. d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work: 1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component; 2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work. 7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work. 8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above. 9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process. 10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license. b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work. 11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means. 12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws. NO WARRANTY =========== There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK ======================= The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'. The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports. The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance. You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role. If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps: 1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search. 2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained. a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data within one month. b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.) 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. 4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer. 5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month. A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license. If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above. WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE ====================================================== This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section. Choosing This License or Another License ---------------------------------------- If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL. The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it. A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution ----------------------------------------------------- It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components. How to Use This License ----------------------- To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license. Here is an example of such a notice and statement: %% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name % % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 % of this license or (at your option) any later version. % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 2005/12/01 or later. % % This work has the LPPL maintenance status "" maintained "". % % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name . % % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file pig.sty . Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'. If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself. Derived Works That Are Not Replacements --------------------------------------- Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply. Important Recommendations ------------------------- Defining What Constitutes the Work The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt. in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.","%% pig.dtx%% Copyright 2005 M.

Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque manière, rien n'empêche un licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des garanties ou du support. 8. Responsabilité Le licencié est responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des droits accordés par la licence. Le concédant ne saurait être tenu responsable du préjudice subi par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y sont accordés. 9. Résiliation La présente licence est résiliée de plein droit dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne sont pas exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont stipulés. Toutefois, si le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30 jours de sa prise de connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu'il s'agit du premier défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau. Pour tout défaut subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est nécessaire afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau. 10. Version de la licence Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses ayants cause ou toute personne qu'il désigne, peuvent diffuser des versions révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version recevra un numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes d'une version spécifique, c'est seulement cette version qui liera les parties à la licence. Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure, auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence lui est accordée. 11. Divers Dans la mesure où le concédant est un ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit public, créés en vertu d'une loi de l'Assemblée nationale du Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls compétents. La présente licence peut être distribuée sans conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause, doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d'identifier la provenance de la licence.",,False,N,N,False

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (""Netscape"") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""Mozilla"", ""MOZILLAPL"", ""MOZPL"", ""Netscape"", ""NPL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis. EXHIBIT A.

New Versions Netscape Communications Corporation (""Netscape"") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2.

No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""Mozilla"", ""MOZILLAPL"", ""MOZPL"", ""Netscape"", ""MPL"", ""NPL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. Termination 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. government end users The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12.

Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. 6. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an ""as is"" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. 7. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 10.

Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.

This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. 7. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 10. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward. 10.3. Modified Versions If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License). 10.4.

(""Licensor""). Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant to this License is a ""Licensed Product."" Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product and has been submitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI) for approval. Preamble This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as ""OSI Certified Open Source Software."" This License provides that: 1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required. 2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms ""Licensed Product,"" ""Modifications,"" ""Contributors"" and ""Source Code"" are defined in the License.) 3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term ""Derivative Works"" is defined in the License.) 4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others. 5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages. 6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code. 7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate. You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product. Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications. New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License. License Terms 1. Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as an executable program. ""Source Code"" means the preferred form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable program, or a list of differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product. b. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product. c. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. ""Modifications"" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term ""Licensed Product"" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a ""Contributor"") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works. b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution. a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e). b. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an ""Electronic Distribution Mechanism""). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. c. Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product. d. Intellectual Property Matters. i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained. ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (""API"") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. e. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the ""Notice"") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer. f. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer. g. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto. 5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it. 6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference. 7. Versions of This License. a. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court. b. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. c. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License. d. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor. 8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 9. Termination. a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as ""Respondent"") alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the ""Notice Period"") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY",,False,N,N,False

545,NGPL,Nethack General Public License,"NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson) (Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman) Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs. The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement. Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights. Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed. Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack. COPYING POLICIES 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute suchmodifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement),provided that you also do the following: a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option) c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.) For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally releasedover Usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code orexecutable. 4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. Stated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else from sharing it farther.",,False,N,N,False

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions Netscape Communications Corporation (""Netscape"") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""Mozilla"", ""MOZILLAPL"", ""MOZPL"", ""Netscape"", ""MPL"", ""NPL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. Termination 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. government end users The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. Responsibility for claims As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13.

Subject to the terms of this License and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license a) under copyrights Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and b) under Patent Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination). c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Software. d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor. 3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. 3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software. 3.4 Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software. 6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. 6.1 New Versions. Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License. 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer. 10. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it. This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. 11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

All Rights Reserved PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE CODE BASE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE (THE ""License""), YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. Section 1. Your Rights Subject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of Research (the ""Original Contributor"") and each subsequent contributor (collectively with the Original Contributor, the ""Contributors"") hereby grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute, prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial purposes, the original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called the ""Program""). Section 2. Definitions A ""Modification"" to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents of any file of the Program and any new file that contains any part of the Program. If you make a Modification and distribute the Program externally you are a ""Contributor."" The distribution of the Program must be under the terms of this license including those in Section 3 below. A ""Combined Work"" results from combining and integrating all or parts of the Program with other code. A Combined Work may be thought of as having multiple parents or being result of multiple lines of code development. Section 3. Distribution Licensing Terms A. General Requirements Except as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction (see below), a distribution of the Program in any of the forms listed below must not put any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein. As a Contributor, you represent that your Modification(s) are your original creation(s) and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modification(s). You represent that each of your Modifications includes complete details of any third-party right or other third-party restriction associated with any part of your Modification (including a copy of any applicable license agreement). The Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically transferring the files to the recipient. This Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be prominently displayed with every distribution of the Program in any form: YOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO: (A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE RESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING THE PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AGAINST CONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM. B. Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications (e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient. In addition, each source and data file of the Program and any Modification you distribute must contain the following notice: "" Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and other contributors .

The Initial Developer of the Original Code is ________________________ . Portions created by ______________________ are Copyright (C) ____________________________ . All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s): ______________________________________ . "" C. Requirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make Modifications (e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient and you must include the following statement in appropriate and conspicuous locations: ""Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved."" In addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution or the distributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request. D. Requirements for a Combined Work Distribution Distributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files to recipient. A Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable code. The requirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions. An ""Aggregate Work"" is when the Program exists, without integration, with other programs on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of ""Program"" provided in this License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License. Also, should the Program be extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program apart from the Aggregate Work. Section 4. License Grant For purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works based on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason. Section 5. Termination of Rights This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action. If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted shall survive such termination. Section 6. Other Terms Except for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. All transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. import/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply. Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any third party. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. The provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect. In substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law. The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License grants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor. This License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of the parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.","""Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and other contributors.

600,ODbL-1.0,Open Data Commons Open Database License v1.0,"Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) Preamble The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database. Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License. ------ The Licensor (as defined below) and You (as defined below) agree as follows: 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words ""Collective Database"" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database. ""Convey"" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. ""Contents"" - The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds. ""Database"" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License. ""Database Directive"" - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded. ""Database Right"" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (""sui generis"") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. ""Derivative Database"" - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database. ""Extraction"" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form. ""License"" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract. ""Licensor"" - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License. ""Person"" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate. ""Produced Work"" - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database. ""Publicly"" - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). ""Re-utilisation"" - means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission. ""Substantial"" - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents. ""Use"" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format. ""You"" - Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. 2.0 What this License covers 2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is: a.

This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database; b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database. 2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images. 3.0 Rights granted 3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future. The rights granted cover, for example: a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents; b. Creation of Derivative Databases; c. Creation of Collective Databases; d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases. 3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt: a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. 3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved. 4.0 Conditions of Use 4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms. 4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must: a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted under Section 4.4; b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License. d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it. 4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License. a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3: Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under the Open Database License (ODbL). DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the URI of the Database. ""Open Database License"" should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the above notice. 		 			 4.4 			Share alike.			 a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of: i. This License; ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or iii. A compatible license. If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used. d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use the compatible license. 4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in the following: a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database; b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4. 4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy in a machine readable form of: a. The entire Derivative Database; or b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the Database and the Derivative Database. The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet. 4.7 Technological measures and additional terms a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights. b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a ""Restricted Database"") in contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the Restricted Database: i. That is available without additional fee; ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights (an ""Unrestricted Database""); and iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database. c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights. 4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. 5.0 Moral rights 5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment: a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database. Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions. 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected 6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including without limitation: a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure. b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. 6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents. 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer 7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor ""as is"" and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You. 8.0 Limitation of liability 8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor. 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License 9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License. 9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it. 9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the duration of applicable rights in the Database. 9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated: a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach; b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8. 9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 10.0 General 10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database. 10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.",,False,N,N,False

375,OGTSL,Open Group Test Suite License,"The Open Group Test Suite License Preamble The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products. For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people. For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software. For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim. As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved. If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees). Definitions: ""Package"" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. ""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. ""You"" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following: rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following: accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. 7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package. 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 9.

You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software			is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy			of this License. You must cause any of Your Modifications to carry			prominent notices stating that You changed the files.			You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights			in the Source Code Form. 		 3.2 Distribution of Executable Form 			If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of	 distribution to the recipient; and b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form	 under this License. 		 3.3 Distribution of a Larger Work 			You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,			provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License			for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination			of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses,			and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses,			this License permits You to additionally distribute			such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),			so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,			further distribute the Covered Software under the terms			of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4 Notices 		You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices		(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,		or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form		of the Covered Software, except that You may alter		any license notices to the extent required to remedy		known factual inaccuracies. 3.5 Application of Additional Terms	 		 3.5.1 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 3.5.2 You may place additional conditions upon the rights granted in this License to the extent necessary due to statute, judicial order, regulation (including without limitation state and federal procurement regulation), national security, or public interest.

However, if You become			compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular			Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until			such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,			and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You			of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days			after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants			from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis			if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance			by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice			of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor,			and You become compliant prior to 30-days			after Your receipt of the notice. 		 5.2 Patent Infringement Claims 			If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting			a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,			counter-claims, and cross-claims ) alleging that a Contributor Version			directly or indirectly infringes any patent,			then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors			for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License			shall terminate. 		 5.3 Additional Compliance Terms 			Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5,			for purposes of this Section, if You breach			Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form),			Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form),			Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or			Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant			as described in Section 5.1 must also include,			no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice			of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software			available in Source Code Form as required by this License			on a publicly available computer network			for a period of no less than three (3) years. 		 5.4 Contributor Remedies 			If You fail to comply with the terms of this License			and do not thereafter become compliant in accordance			with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3,			then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition			to any other rights it may have in law or in equity,			to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages			for willful copyright or patent infringement			(including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment,			where available under law), for all actions in violation			of rights that would otherwise have been granted			under the terms of this License. 		 5.5 End User License Agreements 			In the event of termination under this Section 5,			all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers),			which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors			under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. 		 6.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 		 8. Litigation 			Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

Miscellaneous 			This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 11. Versions of the License 		 11.1 New Versions 			The Open Source Election Technology Foundation (""OSET"")			(formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation)			is the steward of this License.			Except as provided in Section 11.3, no one other than the license steward			has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.

627,RPL-1.5,Reciprocal Public License 1.5,"Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL1.5) Version 1.5, July 15, 2007 Copyright (C) 2001-2007 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved. PREAMBLE The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness. In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a ""third party"". While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base. While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RPL is found in two definitions: ""Deploy"" and ""Required Components"". Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software. Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it. In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document. LICENSE TERMS 1.0 General; Applicability & Definitions.

Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of a) Section 13.8 solely to modify the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define License Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible Attribution Notice, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL. 8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, THAT ANY CONTRIBUTOR'S EXTENSIONS MEET ANY STANDARD OF COMPATIBILITY OR DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (""HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES""). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. 11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software. 12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. 12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as ""Respondent"") alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the ""Notice Period"") unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. 12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 13.0 Miscellaneous. 13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute. 13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. 13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software. 13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction & Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney's fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

489,RPSL-1.0,RealNetworks Public Source License v1.0,"RealNetworks Public Source License Version 1.0 (Rev. Date October 28, 2002) 1. General Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which RealNetworks, Inc., or any other entity that elects to use this license, (""Licensor"") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Licensor identifying such program or work as ""Original Code"" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this RealNetworks Public Source License version 1.0 (or subsequent version thereof) (""License""). You are not required to accept this License. However, nothing else grants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or distributing the software (or any work based on the software), You indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by clicking the Accept button or downloading the software. As used in this License: 1.1 ""Applicable Patent Rights"" mean: (a) in the case where Licensor is the grantor of rights, claims of patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Licensor and (ii) are necessarily infringed by using or making the Original Code alone and not in combination with other software or hardware; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, claims of patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) are infringed (directly or indirectly) by using or making Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code. 1.2 ""Compatible Source License"" means any one of the licenses listed on Exhibit B or at https://www.helixcommunity.org/content/complicense or other licenses specifically identified by Licensor in writing. Notwithstanding any term to the contrary in any Compatible Source License, any code covered by any Compatible Source License that is used with Covered Code must be made readily available in Source Code format for royalty-free use under the terms of the Compatible Source License or this License. 1.3 ""Contributor"" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications. 1.4 ""Covered Code"" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. 1.5 ""Deploy"" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner. 1.6 ""Derivative Work"" means either the Covered Code or any derivative work under United States copyright law, and including any work containing or including any portion of the Covered Code or Modifications, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. Derivative Work also includes any work which combines any portion of Covered Code or Modifications with code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License. 1.7 ""Externally Deploy"" means to Deploy the Covered Code in any way that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way to deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered Code is distributed to those parties, made available as an application intended for use over a computer network, or used to provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than You. 1.8. ""Interface"" means interfaces, functions, properties, class definitions, APIs, header files, GUIDs, V-Tables, and/or protocols allowing one piece of software, firmware or hardware to communicate or interoperate with another piece of software, firmware or hardware. 1.9 ""Modifications"" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code. 1.10 ""Original Code"" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Licensor under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Licensor under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Licensor as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor under this License. 1.11 ""Personal Use"" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An individual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use. 1.12 ""Source Code"" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code). 1.13 ""You"" or ""Your"" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, ""You"" or ""Your"" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where ""control"" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity. 2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover the Original Code, to do the following: 2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance: (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6; (c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; (d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and (e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the ""about"" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed, including any packaging materials. 2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such license(s). 2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this License. 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License: (a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and (b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution. (c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor. 4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications. 4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above. 4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way with the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software. 4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this License. 5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware. 5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor (""Licensor Marks"" defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C. 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (""Additional Terms"") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS ""LICENSOR"" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00). 10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor (""Licensor Modifications""), and such Licensor Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 11. Termination. 11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit); (d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit). 11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a ""commercial item"" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary authorizations. 12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Washington. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Governed Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Governed Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Governed Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by RSV and including the name of RSV in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Governed Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. 3.4.1. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained. In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of your Modifications. 3.4.2. Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Governed Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of RSV or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by RSV or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Governed Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of theterms of this License with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Trademark Usage. 5.1. Advertising Materials. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: ""This product includes software developed by Ricoh Silicon Valley, Inc."" 5.2. Endorsements. The names ""Ricoh,"" ""Ricoh Silicon Valley,"" and ""RSV"" must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of RSV. 5.3.

Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. RSV may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Governed Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Governed Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by RSV. No one other than RSV has the right to modify the terms applicable to Governed Code created under this License. 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. GOVERNED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE GOVERNED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY GOVERNED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT RSV OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY GOVERNED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. Termination. 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Governed Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate patent infringement litigation against RSV or a Contributor (RSV or the Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as ""Participant"") alleging that: (a) such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of the Original Code or the Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Original Code or the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device provided to You by the Participant, other than such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Original Code or the Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL RSV ' S LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY DANGEROUS APPLICATION THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE OR MASS DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED CODE. 10. U.S. Government End Users. The Governed Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney ' s fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. Responsibility for Claims. Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS U.S. Government: If this Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in the Software and accompanying documentation shall be only as set forth in this license; this is in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DoD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DoD acquisitions). 11.0 MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

572,SimPL-2.0,Simple Public License 2.0,"Simple Public License (SimPL) Preamble This Simple Public License 2.0 (SimPL 2.0 for short) is a plain language implementation of GPL 2.0. The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change software. If anyone wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0. Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0 The SimPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software. You get the royalty free right to: - Use the software for any purpose; - Make derivative works of it (this is called a ""Derived Work""); - Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work. If you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by: - Prominently noting the date of any changes you make; - Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license terms in place; - Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify; - Licensing it to everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL 2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided; - Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license. There are some things that you must shoulder: - You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind; - If the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called ""consequential damages."" (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you); The SimPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically if: - You do not abide by the ""give back to the community"" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide); - Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the SimPL. License for the License You may do anything that you want with the SimPL text; it's a license form to use in any way that you find helpful. To avoid confusion, however, if you change the terms in any way then you may not call your license the Simple Public License or the SimPL (but feel free to acknowledge that your license is ""based on the Simple Public License"").",,False,N,N,False

971,Vim,Vim License,"VIM LICENSE I) There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except that they must include this license text. You can also distribute unmodified parts of Vim , likewise unrestricted except that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts. II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim , including executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are met: 1) This license text must be included unmodified. 2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways: a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution how to contactyou. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed,you must make your changes, including source code, available to the maintainer without fee.The maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the official version of Vim . Whatthe maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will be distributed isnegotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a later version, alsoapplies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. Ifthis changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.organd/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, theobligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he hasreceived your changes they will not have to be sent again. b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned under a) you are allowed tofurther distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional changes the textunder a) applies to those changes. c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the modified Vim youdistribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. You can choose what license to usefor new code you add. The changes and their license must not restrict others from making theirown changes to the official version of Vim . d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute itwithout the source code for the changes if the following three conditions are met: - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute the changes to the Vimmaintainer without fee or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include the changesin the official version of Vim without fee or restriction. - You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim . When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in anyway) for the changes within this period, you must make them available to him. - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This contact information must remainvalid for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim , or aslong as possible. e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version. 3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the "":version"" command and in the introscreen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see that it was modified. Whendistributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as thisdoes not conflict with the license used for the changes. 4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be removed or changed, exceptthat the person himself can make corrections. III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim , you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org> IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version.

Grant of Copyright License 1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a ""Modification;"" however, any file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a ""Modification."" 1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement. 1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software.

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 6. Term and Termination 6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6. 6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement. 6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

Miscellaneous This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.

No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.",,False,N,N,False
